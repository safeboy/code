Welcome to your new IMAPEngine server.

It seems as if it would work properly, since you can read this email.

To add more user accounts and pop3 sources use the integrated web interface at
your.domain.com:8282 or the port you defined in the ./programm/easyserv.ini

For more information visit the www.imapengine.org website.

Thank you for trying IMAPEngine.

Thomas
